/**
 * Returns collection of Linode types, including pricing and specifications for each
 * type. These are used when creating or resizing Linodes.
 *
 * @property string      $id          The ID representing the Linode Type.
 * @property string      $label       The Linode Type's label is for display purposes only.
 * @property string      $class       The class of the Linode Type.
 *                                    We currently offer six classes of compute instances:
 *                                    * `nanode` - Nanode instances are good for low-duty workloads, where performance
 *                                    isn't critical. **Note:** As of June 16th, 2020, Nanodes became 1 GB Linodes in
 *                                    the Cloud Manager, however, the API, the CLI, and billing will continue to refer
 *                                    to these instances as Nanodes.
 *                                    * `standard` - Standard Shared instances are good for medium-duty workloads and
 *                                    are a good mix of performance, resources, and price. **Note:** As of June 16th,
 *                                    2020, Standard Linodes in the Cloud Manager became Shared Linodes, however, the
 *                                    API, the CLI, and billing will continue to refer to these instances as Standard
 *                                    Linodes.
 *                                    * `dedicated` - Dedicated CPU instances are good for full-duty workloads where
 *                                    consistent performance is important.
 *                                    * `premium` (limited Regions) - In addition to the features of Dedicated
 *                                    instances, Premium instances come equipped with the latest AMD EPYC&trade; CPUs,
 *                                    ensuring your applications are running on the latest hardware with consistently
 *                                    high performance. Only available in Regions with "Premium Plans" in their
 *                                    `capabilities`
 *                                    * `gpu` (limited Regions) - Linodes with dedicated NVIDIA Quadro(R) RTX 6000
 *                                    GPUs accelerate highly specialized applications such as machine learning, AI, and
 *                                    video transcoding. Only available in Regions with "GPU Linodes" in their
 *                                    `capabilities`
 *                                    * `highmem` - High Memory instances favor RAM over other resources, and can be
 *                                    good for memory hungry use cases like caching and in-memory databases. All High
 *                                    Memory plans contain dedicated CPU cores.
 * @property int         $disk        The Disk size, in MB, of the Linode Type.
 * @property int         $memory      Amount of RAM included in this Linode Type.
 * @property int         $vcpus       The number of VCPU cores this Linode Type offers.
 * @property int         $network_out The Mbits outbound bandwidth allocation.
 * @property int         $transfer    The monthly outbound transfer amount, in MB.
 * @property int         $gpus        The number of GPUs this Linode Type offers.
 * @property Price       $price       Cost in US dollars, broken down into hourly and monthly charges.
 * @property object      $addons      A list of optional add-on services for Linodes and their associated costs.
 * @property null|string $successor   The Linode Type that a mutate will upgrade to for a Linode of this type. If
 *                                    "null", a Linode of this type may not mutate.
