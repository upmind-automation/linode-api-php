     * as the Device's `entity`). Currently, only Devices with an entity of type `linode`
     * are accepted.
     * A Firewall can be assigned a single Linode service at a time. Additional disabled
     * Firewalls can be
     * assigned to a service, but they cannot be enabled if another active Firewall
     * is already assigned to the same service.
     *
     * Creating a Firewall Device will apply the Rules from a Firewall to a Linode
     * service.
     * A `firewall_device_add` Event is generated when the Firewall Device is added
     * successfully.
     *
     * **Note:** When a Firewall is assigned to a Linode and you attempt
     * to migrate the Linode to a data center that does not support Cloud Firewalls, the
     * migration will fail.
