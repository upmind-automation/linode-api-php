/**
 * A NodeBalancer config represents the configuration of this NodeBalancer on a
 * single port. For example, a NodeBalancer Config on port 80 would typically
 * represent how this NodeBalancer response to HTTP requests.
 *
 * NodeBalancer configs have a list of backends, called "nodes," that they forward
 * requests between based on their configuration.
