/**
 * Information about Linode's backups schedule.
 *
 * @property string $day    The day of the week that your Linode's weekly Backup is taken.
 *                          If not set manually, a day will be chosen for you. Backups
 *                          are taken every day, but backups taken on this day are
 *                          preferred when selecting backups to retain for a longer period.
 *                          If not set manually, then when backups are initially enabled, this
 *                          may come back as `Scheduling` until the `day` is automatically
 *                          selected (@see `DAY_...` constants).
 * @property string $window The window in which your backups will be taken, in UTC. A
 *                          backups window is a two-hour span of time in which the backup
 *                          may occur.
 *                          For example, `W10` indicates that your backups should be
 *                          taken between 10:00 and 12:00. If you do not choose a backup
 *                          window, one will be selected for you automatically.
 *                          If not set manually, when backups are initially enabled this
 *                          may come back as `Scheduling` until the `window` is automatically
 *                          selected (@see `WINDOW_...` constants).
