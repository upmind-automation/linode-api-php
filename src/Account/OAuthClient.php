/**
 * A third-party application registered to Linode that users may log into
 * with their Linode account through our authentication server at
 * https://login.linode.com. Using an OAuth Client, a third-party
 * developer may be given access to some, or all, of a User's account for
 * the purposes of their application.
 *
 * @property string      $id            The OAuth Client ID. This is used to identify the client, and is a
 *                                      publicly-known value (it is not a secret).
 * @property string      $label         The name of this application. This will be presented to users when they
 *                                      are asked to grant it access to their Account.
 * @property string      $status        The status of this application (@see `STATUS_...` constants).
 * @property bool        $public        If this is a public or private OAuth Client. Public clients have a slightly
 *                                      different authentication workflow than private clients. See the
 *                                      OAuth spec (https://oauth.net/2/) for more details.
 * @property string      $redirect_uri  The location a successful log in from https://login.linode.com should be
 *                                      redirected to for this client. The receiver of this redirect should be
 *                                      ready to accept an OAuth exchange code and finish the OAuth exchange.
 *                                      example: https://example.org/oauth/callback
 * @property string      $secret        The OAuth Client secret, used in the OAuth exchange. This is returned
 *                                      as `<REDACTED>` except when an OAuth Client is created or its secret
 *                                      is reset. This is a secret, and should not be shared or disclosed
 *                                      publicly.
 * @property null|string $thumbnail_url The URL where this client's thumbnail may be viewed, or `null` if this client
 *                                      does not have a thumbnail set.
