     * When created successfully, a confirmation email is sent to the account that
     * created this transfer containing a
     * transfer token and instructions on completing the transfer.
     *
     * When a transfer is accepted, the requested services are moved to
     * the receiving account. Linode services will not experience interruptions due to
     * the transfer process. Backups
     * for Linodes are transferred as well.

     * DNS records that are associated with requested services will not be transferred or
